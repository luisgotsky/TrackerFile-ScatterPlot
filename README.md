# TrackerFile-ScatterPlot
Given a tracker file with given t and x will plot a scatter type of graph

<-- How to Use -->

Using Tracker to track an object you should export a data file with two columns given, a t column for time and an x column for position. Note that when you export the file
that you'll get will have the name of the object as it's title. <b>It's important that you delete this title and only leave names for the columns and then the data</b>

Then you should run the .py file using your favourite IDE or Python, the program will ask for a file of data and you should give it the route of that file, then it will make
a scatter plot type and save it in the same route that the script is saved. The program will also ask for the name of the file.

This script can't be run through the command line (yet)
